//  and one containing the last name. You can do that by using the while (sc.hasNext())

            //The hasNext() method reads a token, and stops if it reaches a delimiter. If the method is being kept invoking, it reads the next token and stops if it reaches another delimiter. The whole process repeats until there is no more token.
            //Actually, the hasNext() method does not read the tokens, rather it just checks to see if there are any more tokens left.
            //The one that actually reads and returns the tokens is the next() method.
